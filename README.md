# PRODIGY_CS_02
Hey everyone! 👋 Excited to share the second task of my Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy InfoTech!  For this task, I developed a simple image encryption tool using pixel-level manipulation in Python. The idea was to explore how even basic mathematical operations like XOR can be used to protect digital images. 🔢🖼️
